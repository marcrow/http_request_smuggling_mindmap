# HTTP Request smuggling mindmap

This project has to objective to help me (and others) to exploit HTTTP request smuggling attacks.

This first version is based on last James Kettle article (http1.1 must die) + AI knowlege + my experience (I'm really not an expert on this subject).

I will update this mind map alongside the development of my skills in this domain.

To generate the mindmap you will need to use excallimap :  https://github.com/marcrow/excalimap 

But you will find here the last svg and png version (if i don't forget to update it ^^).
